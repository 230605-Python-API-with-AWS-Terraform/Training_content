    -   **_ WHERE => to filter rows returned by a SELECT statement._**

        -   "=" -> Equal

            -   ```sql
                SELECT username, password FROM accounts WHERE username = 'serhat';
                ```

        -   "\>" -> Greater than

        -   "<" -> Less than

        -   "\>=" -> Greater than or equal

                ```

        -   AND

            -   Logical operator AND
            -   ```sql

                ```

        -   IN

            -   Return true if a value matches any value in a list
            -   ```sql
                SELECT username, password FROM accounts WHERE username IN ('serhat', 'melek');
                ```

        -   LIKE

                ```

        -   IS

            -   NULL Return true if a value is NULL

        -   NOT

            -   Negate the result of other operators

        -   BETWEEN

                SELECT username, password FROM accounts WHERE LENGTH(username) BETWEEN 5 AND 6;
                ```

    -   **_ LIMIT => to get a subset of rows generated by a query. - To Constrain The Number Of Returned Rows_**

        -   ```sql
            SELECT identity, username, password FROM accounts ORDER BY identity LIMIT 4;
            ```

        -   With OFFSET Example

            -   ```sql
                SELECT identity, username, password FROM accounts ORDER BY identity LIMIT 4 OFFSET 3;
                ```
                -- Starting from fourth row to seventh row.

        -   OFFSET To Get Top/Bottom N Rows

            -   ```sql
                SELECT identity, username, password FROM accounts ORDER BY identity DESC LIMIT 4;
                ```

    -   **_ FETCH => to retrieve a portion of rows returned by query._**

        -   ```sql
            SELECT identity, username, password FROM accounts ORDER BY identity FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;
            ```

    -   **_ IN => to check if a value matches any value in list._**

        -   Syntax

            -   ```sql
                SELECT identity, username, password FROM accounts WHERE id IN (3, 7) ORDER BY identity DESC;
                ```
                -- returns rows that match the given id numbers.

        -   NOT IN

            -   ```sql
                SELECT identity, username, password FROM accounts WHERE id NOT IN (3, 7) ORDER BY identity DESC;
                ```
                -- returns all rows except id numbers 3 and 7.

        -   Example

            -   ```sql
                SELECT identity, username, password FROM accounts WHERE username IN (SELECT identity FROM rental WHERE CAST (creating_date AS DATE) <> '2001-01-08') ORDER BY identity;
                ```

    -   **_ BETWEEN => to match a value againts a range of values._**

        -   Syntax

            -   ```sql

                ```

        -   Example

            -   ```sql
                SELECT identity, username, password FROM accounts WHERE creating_date BETWEEN '2007-02-07' AND '2007-02-15';
                ```

    -   **_ LIKE => to query data using pattern matchings. (case sensitive)_**

        -   Example

            -   ```sql
                SELECT username, password FROM accounts WHERE username LIKE 'mel%';
                ```
            -   ```sql
                SELECT username, password FROM accounts WHERE username LIKE '_ele_';
                ```
            -   ```sql
                SELECT username, password FROM accounts WHERE username LIKE 'mele\_';
                ```
            -   ```sql
                SELECT username, password FROM accounts WHERE username LIKE '\_el%';
                ```
            -   ```sql
                SELECT username, password FROM accounts WHERE username LIKE '%le\_';
                ```

        -   NOT LIKE

            -   ```sql
                SELECT username, password FROM accounts WHERE username NOT LIKE 'mel%';
                ```

        -   ILIKE (non case sensitive)

            -   ```sql
                SELECT username, password FROM accounts WHERE username ILIKE 'mel%';
                ```

    -   **_ IS NULL => to check if a value is null or not._**

        -   Example

            -   ```sql
                SELECT username, password, phone FROM accounts WHERE phone IS NULL;
                ```

        -   IS NOT NULL

            -   ```sql
                SELECT username, password, phone FROM accounts WHERE phone IS NOT NULL;
                ```
