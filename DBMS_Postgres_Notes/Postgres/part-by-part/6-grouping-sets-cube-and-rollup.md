6.  # GROUPING SETS, CUBE AND ROLLUP

    -   **_GROUPING SETS => to generate multiple grouping sets in a query._**

        -   The Outputs Of The Following Two Clauses Are The Same.

            -   ```sql
                SELECT brand, segment, SUM (quantity)
                FROM sales
                GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ( (brand, segment), (brand), (segment), () );
                ```
            -   ```sql
                SELECT brand, segment, SUM (quantity)
                FROM sales
                GROUP BY brand, segment
                UNION ALL
                SELECT brand, NULL, SUM (quantity)
                FROM sales GROUP BY brand
                UNION ALL
                SELECT NULL, segment, SUM (quantity)
                FROM sales GROUP BY segment
                UNION ALL
                SELECT NULL, NULL, SUM (quantity)
                FROM sales;
                ```

    -   **_CUBE => to generate multiple grouping sets. (with all combinations)_**

        -   Given Same Output as GROUPING SETS's Examples.

            -   ```sql
                SELECT brand, segment, SUM (quantity) quantity
                FROM sales
                GROUP BY CUBE (brand, segment);
                ```

    -   **_ROLLUP => to generate multiple grouping sets. (it just makes subset of those.)_**

        -   Example

            -   ```sql
                SELECT brand, segment, SUM (quantity)
                FROM sales
                GROUP BY ROLLUP (brand, segment)
                ORDER BY segment, brand;
                ```
