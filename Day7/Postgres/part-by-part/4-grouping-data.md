4.  # GROUPING DATA

    -   **_GROUP BY => to divide rows into groups._**

        -   Without An Aggregate Function Example (similar to SELECT DISTINCT)

            -   ```sql
                SELECT customer_id FROM payment GROUP BY customer_id;
                ```
            -   ```sql
                SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM payment;
                ```

        -   With SUM () Function Example

            -   ```sql
                SELECT customer_id, SUM (amounts) AS amount
                FROM payment
                GROUP BY customer_id
                ORDER BY amount DESC;
                ```

        -   Clause With The JOIN Clause

            -   ```sql
                SELECT first_name || '*' || last_name full_name, SUM (amounts) amount
                FROM payment
                INNER JOIN customer USING (customer_id)
                GROUP BY full_name
                ORDER BY customer_id DESC;
                ```

        -   With COUNT () Function Example

            -   ```sql
                 SELECT staff_id, COUNT (payment_id)
                 FROM payment
                 GROUP BY staff_id;
                ```

        -   With Multiple Columns

            -   ```sql
                SELECT customer_id, staff_id, SUM(amount)
                FROM payment
                GROUP BY staff_id, customer_id
                ORDER BY customer_id;
                ```

        -   With Date Column

            -   ```sql
                SELECT DATE(payment_date) paid_date, SUM(amount) sum
                FROM payment
                GROUP BY DATE(payment_date);
                ```

    -   **_HAVING => to specify a search condition for a group or an aggregate._**

        -   HAVING vs. WHERE

            -   The WHERE clause allows you to filter rows based on a specified
                condition. However, the HAVING clause allows you to filter groups
                of rows according to a specified condition.

        -   Clause With SUM () Function Example

            -   ```sql
                SELECT customer_id, SUM (amount)
                FROM payment
                GROUP BY customer_id
                HAVING SUM (amount) > 200;
                ```

        -   Clause With COUNT () Function Example

            -   ```sql
                SELECT store_id, COUNT (customer_id)
                FROM customer
                GROUP BY store_id
                HAVING COUNT (customer_id) > 300;
                ```
